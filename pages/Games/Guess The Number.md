## 🔢 Guess the Number

### Overview

The "Guess the Number" game is a fun and engaging activity where players guess a number within a specified range.

### Starting the Game

The host can start the game with the command:
```!gtn <number-range>```  
For example: ```!gtn 500```  
The bot will send a direct message (DM) to the host with the chosen number from within that range.

*Note: The host requires the bot's event manager role.*

### Game Progression

- Once the channel is unlocked, players can start guessing the number.
- The game ends when a player correctly guesses the chosen number, and the channel is then locked.

### Extra Information

- 🐌 The host can activate slow mode during the game if needed.
- 💡 If the game takes too long, the host can temporarily lock the channel to provide an additional hint.

**Good luck on testing your guessing skills!**
